# 🛍️ Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) Dashboard Project

An end-to-end data analytics project to segment customers and estimate their Lifetime Value (LTV) using Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn) and Tableau. The goal is to help businesses identify their most valuable customers and optimize marketing strategies.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

Build a complete data pipeline and dashboard to:

- Clean and preprocess customer transaction data
- Calculate RFM metrics (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
- Generate a normalized **LTV Score**
- Segment customers based on behavior
- Visualize actionable insights in an interactive Tableau dashboard

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)** – Data cleaning, RFM calculation, clustering, and LTV scoring
- **Tableau** – Dashboard creation & interactive visualizations
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and hosting
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For reproducible Python code
- **CSV Dataset** – Online retail transactions data
